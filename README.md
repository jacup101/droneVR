# Drone VR
Hello, welcome to my senior comps project, currently codenamed "drone vr" (although I am very much open to name suggestions)

The goal for this project is to end up with a fully playable virtual reality, drone rhythm game, alongside a potential proof of concept for a drone augmented reality game with similar game mechanics. This currently only contains the assets folder from the Unity project, most of the code that I am writing can be found in the Scripts subdirectory.
